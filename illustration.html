            <p class = 'info'> What's under the bed is an orginal story I created during my sophmore year. A semester long project 
                of iteration, and expirimentation, I decided to create an orginal childrens book which was to be presented 
                in front a panel of faculty from Stamps School of Art and Design. They would critique my presented project and 
                help advise me on my next two years within the program, including if I should continue within the BFA program 
                at Stamps. Luckily I passed and currenlty am taking upper level animation and illustration courses!
