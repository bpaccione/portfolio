        <h2> Style Frame</h2>
        <p class = "info"> a rotoscope aniamtion is where you are taking footage either found or shot by the aritst
            that helps imply your making process for creating the aniamtion. Meaning you are tracing over
            or manipulating / adding to the video to combine both 4d and 2d media.

        <h2> Rotoscope Animation</h2>
        <p class = "info"> For this animation I complied footage I had taken of my brother skiiing in past years
            and edited those clips together to have a base for my animation. I then used photoshop and 
            an aniamtion plug in to draw each and every frame seen in the vide. It took a very long time,
            but I am very happy with the result.

        <h1> One Right Now - After Affects</h1>

        <video width = "100%" height = "auto" controls>
            <source src = "images/one_right_now.mp4">
        </video>

        <h2> After Affects Animation</h2>
        <p class = "info"> While theres is not style frame for this animation, there was still alot of planning 
            to go into it. This animation was made in after affects and animated to the song "One
            Right Now" by Post Malone and The WKND. By choosing a song, and clip of the song, and 
            animating to the beat by manipualting shapes rather than drawing each frame, I did lots 
            of research about the different affects I coudl create within this software. I then impleted
            what I learned into differnet parts of the video to match the music.
